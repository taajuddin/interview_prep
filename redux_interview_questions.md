# Redux Interview Questions & Answers

This document contains frequently asked **Redux interview questions** with simple and clear explanations.

---

## 1. What is Redux?
Redux is a **state management library** for JavaScript applications. It helps manage application state in a predictable way using a **single source of truth (store)**.

---

## 2. Why do we use Redux?
- Centralized state management
- Predictable behavior
- Easier debugging
- Consistent state across components
- Better for large-scale applications

---

## 3. What are the core principles of Redux?
1. **Single Source of Truth** → The state of your application is stored in one object.
2. **State is Read-only** → The only way to change the state is by dispatching an action.
3. **Changes using Pure Functions** → Reducers specify how the state changes based on actions.

---

## 4. What are Actions in Redux?
- **Plain JavaScript objects** that describe what happened.
- Must have a `type` property.

```js
const addTodo = { type: "ADD_TODO", payload: "Learn Redux" };
```

---

## 5. What are Reducers?
- **Pure functions** that take the current state and an action, and return the new state.

```js
function todoReducer(state = [], action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "ADD_TODO":
      return [...state, action.payload];
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

---

## 6. What is a Redux Store?
- A single object that holds the **application state**.
- Created using `createStore()`.

```js
import { createStore } from "redux";
const store = createStore(todoReducer);
```

---

## 7. What is Middleware in Redux?
- Middleware lets you **extend Redux** with custom functionality.
- Common example: **redux-thunk** for async actions.

```js
const logger = store => next => action => {
  console.log("Dispatching:", action);
  return next(action);
};
```

---

## 8. What is Redux Thunk?
- A middleware that allows writing **async logic** (like API calls) inside action creators.

```js
const fetchUsers = () => async (dispatch) => {
  dispatch({ type: "FETCH_USERS_REQUEST" });
  const res = await fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users");
  const data = await res.json();
  dispatch({ type: "FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS", payload: data });
};
```

## 9. Difference between Redux and Context API?
| Feature            | Redux | Context API |
|--------------------|-------|-------------|
| Purpose            | State management | Prop drilling solution |
| Boilerplate        | More   | Less        |
| Async handling     | Yes (middlewares) | No |
| Scalability        | Best for large apps | Small to medium apps |

---

## 10. What are Redux Toolkit and its benefits?
- **Redux Toolkit (RTK)** is the official, recommended way to write Redux logic.
- Provides utilities like `createSlice`, `configureStore`, and `createAsyncThunk`.
- Reduces boilerplate and simplifies Redux setup.

```js
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => { state.value += 1 },
    decrement: (state) => { state.value -= 1 }
  }
});
```

---

## 11. How do you connect Redux with React?
- Using `react-redux` package.
- `Provider` makes the store available.
- `useSelector` to read state, `useDispatch` to dispatch actions.

```js
import { Provider, useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";

function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector(state => state.counter.value);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <>
      <p>{count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "INCREMENT" })}>+</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

## 12. Common Redux Interview Tricky Questions
- Is Redux synchronous or asynchronous? → **By default synchronous, async via middleware**.
- Can Redux work without React? → **Yes, it’s a JS library, not React-specific**.
- Is Redux always necessary? → **No, only for large-scale apps with complex state**.

---

## ✅ Quick Recap
- Redux = predictable state management
- Uses **store, actions, reducers**
- Async → Middleware like **Thunk / Saga**
- Modern way → **Redux Toolkit (RTK)**
