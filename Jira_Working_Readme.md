# Jira Working Explained (Precise & Easy)

This README provides a clear, simple understanding of how **Jira works
in software projects**, along with a visual diagram.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 📌 What is Jira?

Jira is a **project management and issue-tracking tool** used by
software teams to plan, track, and deliver features efficiently.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚀 How Jira Works (Short & Practical)

### **1. Project**

A project contains all tasks (issues) related to your product.

### **2. Issue Types**

-   **Epic** -- Large module  (**example:**  “User Authentication Module”)
-   **Story** -- Feature request  (**example:** “User can log in with email”)
-   **Task** -- Work item  (**example:**  “Integrate payment gateway”)
-   **Bug** -- Issue to fix (**example:** “Login button not working”

### **3. Workflow**

Issues move through stages: - To Do
- In Progress
- In Review
- Testing
- Done

### **4. Boards**

-   **Scrum** -- Sprint-based
-   **Kanban** -- Continuous flow

### **5. Sprint Cycle**

1.  Sprint Planning
2.  Development
3.  Daily Standup
4.  Review
5.  Retrospective

### **6. Backlog**

All upcoming tasks stored and prioritized.

### 🗓️ 7. Sprints (Scrum Teams Only)

- A sprint is a short development cycle.
# Sprint Process:
1. **Sprint Planning** – Choose tasks from the backlog
2. **Sprint Execution** – Team works on selected tasks
3. **Daily Scrum** – Check progress
4. **Sprint Review** – Demo the completed work
5. **Sprint Retrospective** – Improve next sprint

- Jira tracks sprint progress using a Burndown Chart.

### **8. Integrations**

GitHub, Bitbucket, CI/CD, Slack, Confluence, etc.

### 📊 9. Reporting

- Jira provides helpful reports:

1. Burndown chart
2. Velocity chart
3. Sprint report
4. Bug report
5. Time tracking

# These help team leads and managers track progress.

## ✅ Summary

Jira helps teams: - Organize work
- Track progress
- Improve collaboration
- Deliver software faster

# In Very Simple Terms

- Jira is like a digital board where the entire team puts their work, tracks progress, collaborates, and delivers software in a structured way.
- It brings transparency, accountability, and order to the project.
