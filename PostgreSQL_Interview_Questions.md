# PostgreSQL Interview Questions and Answers

This document provides PostgreSQL interview questions and answers tailored for backend developers with 5 years of experience.

## 🧠 1. What is PostgreSQL and why is it popular?
**Answer:**  
PostgreSQL is an open-source, object-relational database system known for its reliability, feature richness, and standards compliance. It supports advanced data types (JSONB, arrays, hstore), full ACID compliance, extensibility (custom types/functions), and strong performance with large datasets.

**Why it's popular:**
- Open-source and enterprise-grade performance  
- Extensible with stored procedures and custom types  
- Advanced indexing (GIN, GiST, BRIN, etc.)  
- Excellent support for JSON data  
- Strong community and tooling

## ⚙️ 2. What are the key differences between PostgreSQL and MySQL?
| Feature | PostgreSQL | MySQL |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Data Model | Object-relational | Relational |
| JSON Support | JSON & JSONB (binary) | JSON (text-based) |
| ACID Compliance | Full | Depends on storage engine (InnoDB) |
| Index Types | B-tree, GIN, GiST, BRIN, Hash | B-tree, Full-text |
| Concurrency Control | MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) | MVCC (limited) |
| Extensibility | Highly extensible | Limited |

---

## 📦 3. Explain MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control).
**Answer:**  
MVCC allows concurrent transactions without locking conflicts. Instead of locking rows for reads, PostgreSQL keeps multiple versions of a row in memory — one per transaction.  
Each transaction sees only committed data as of its start time, ensuring consistency without blocking writes.

**Benefits:**
- No read locks → better concurrency  
- Consistent reads → predictable results  
- Supports isolation levels cleanly  

---

## 🧩 4. How do transactions work in PostgreSQL?
**Answer:**  
A transaction is a sequence of operations executed as a single logical unit of work.

**Example:**
```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;
```
If any statement fails, you can rollback:
```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

**Properties (ACID):**
- **Atomicity:** All or nothing  
- **Consistency:** Maintains database integrity  
- **Isolation:** Each transaction is independent  
- **Durability:** Data persists after commit  

---

## 🔍 5. What are indexes and what types does PostgreSQL support?
**Answer:**  
Indexes speed up data retrieval at the cost of additional writes and storage.

**Common Index Types:**
- **B-Tree:** Default; good for equality and range queries.  
- **GIN:** For full-text search and JSONB.  
- **GiST:** Geometric and full-text data.  
- **BRIN:** For large tables with sequential data (e.g., time-series).  
- **Hash:** Equality lookups.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
```

---

## ⚡ 6. What is the difference between `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL JOIN`?
**Answer:**
```sql
-- INNER JOIN → rows that match both tables
SELECT * FROM users u INNER JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;

-- LEFT JOIN → all rows from left + matched from right
SELECT * FROM users u LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;

-- FULL JOIN → all rows from both sides, matching where possible
SELECT * FROM users u FULL JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;
```

## 🧱 7. How do you handle performance tuning in PostgreSQL?
**Answer:**  
Performance tuning involves optimizing queries, indexing, and configurations.

**Tips:**
- Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to inspect query plans  
- Add indexes where necessary (avoid over-indexing)  
- Use connection pooling (PgBouncer)  
- Optimize `work_mem`, `shared_buffers`, `effective_cache_size`  
- Archive old data, use partitioning  
- Avoid SELECT *  

---

## 🔐 8. How do you implement authentication and authorization using PostgreSQL?
**Answer:**  
PostgreSQL supports multiple authentication methods via `pg_hba.conf` (password, trust, GSSAPI, etc.)  
You can create database roles and assign privileges.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE ROLE backend_user LOGIN PASSWORD 'securePass123';
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON TABLE users TO backend_user;
```

---

## 💾 9. How do you store and query JSON data?
**Answer:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  data JSONB
);

INSERT INTO products (data) VALUES ('{"name": "Phone", "price": 500}');

SELECT data->>'name' AS name FROM products WHERE data->>'price' = '500';
```

**JSONB advantages:**  
- Binary format → faster indexing and querying  
- Supports GIN indexes for key/value searches  

---

## 🧮 10. How do you implement pagination in PostgreSQL?
**Answer:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY id LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```
For large datasets, use keyset pagination for better performance:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE id > 20 ORDER BY id LIMIT 10;
```

---

## 🧰 11. Explain the role of `VACUUM` and `ANALYZE`.
**Answer:**
- **VACUUM:** Removes dead tuples to reclaim storage.  
- **ANALYZE:** Updates statistics used by the query planner for better optimization.  
- **AUTO-VACUUM:** Automatically runs these periodically.

---

## 🧱 12. How do you perform database migrations in Node.js projects?
**Answer:**  
Use migration tools like **Knex.js**, **TypeORM**, or **Sequelize**.

**Example (Knex):**
```bash
npx knex migrate:make create_users_table
npx knex migrate:latest
```

---

## ⚙️ 13. What are Common Table Expressions (CTEs)?
**Answer:**
CTEs are temporary result sets used within a query for readability and modularity.

```sql
WITH recent_orders AS (
  SELECT * FROM orders WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM recent_orders;
```

---

## 🧩 14. What is the difference between `DELETE`, `TRUNCATE`, and `DROP`?
| Command | Action | Rollback | Speed |
|----------|---------|-----------|-------|
| DELETE | Removes rows conditionally | Yes | Slow |
| TRUNCATE | Removes all rows | Yes (if in transaction) | Fast |
| DROP | Removes entire table/schema | No | Fastest |

---

## 🧠 15. How do you handle database connection pooling?
**Answer:**
Connection pooling reduces overhead by reusing connections.

**Example (Node.js using pg-pool):**
```js
import { Pool } from 'pg';

const pool = new Pool({
  user: 'postgres',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'mydb',
  password: 'pass',
  port: 5432,
  max: 10
});

const res = await pool.query('SELECT NOW()');
console.log(res.rows);
```

- Robust transaction management  
- Rich data types and JSONB support  
- Strong indexing and query optimization  
- Scalable with connection pooling and partitioning
